dotfiles
========
Some Dotfiles that are cool. Tried to keep them more minimal and add-as-I-go, rather than duping someone else's.
Files can be ```source```'d or maybe I should make a script to do some of this. Prefer checking out to ```~/.dotfiles/```

### Mac OS X
```vimrc``` to ```~/.vimrc```
```zshrc``` to ```~/.zshrc``` or  ```source ~/.dotfiles/zshrc```
```ghci``` to ```~/.ghci``` or  ```source ~/.dotfiles/vimrc```
```hgrc``` to [```/etc/mercurial/hgrc```](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html)
```tmux.conf``` to ```~/.tmux.conf```
